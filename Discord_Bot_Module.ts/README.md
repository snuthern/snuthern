# Discord_Bot_Module

There are a few different modules you can use to create Discord bots. This one is for Deno. I am creating this module then adding it to the Deno land third party module database so other users can use this module to create bots with.  
  
I will make a simple bot client with it later and add it to the *examples** directory in this repo. Docs can be found in **_docs_** after I create them. Testing is under **_tests_**. I tried to keep commenting in the code easy to read and understand.
