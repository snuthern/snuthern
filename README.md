### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my GitHub profile


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Typescript module to create discord bots that you can find in [Discord_Bot_Module.ts](Discord_Bot_Module.ts/), and redoing my **portfolio** repo with some cool projects like  [tribute pages](https://snuthern.github.io/projects) for each person of color killed this year by police violence and a Typescript [Point_Of_Sale](Point_Of_Sale.ts/) software side project. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Deno , TypeScript , Python , and JavaScript  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything Typescript / Deno related  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **Yossi#3116** on Discord or @snuthern on Twitter  
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He / Him  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I run a discord server dedicated to helping new developers https://discord.gg/xTmG8Da  
  
This simple README file serves as a "monorepo" for my portfolio, I used to have a portfolio repo on here but I removed it when these profile READMEs came out for user profiles. I am in the process of rewriting my Discord module and TorahChat bot, I am creating a point of sale software for a fun side project. Click on the **snuthern** repo below and go to the Wiki to view my projects. I also use the "modules" directory to store code challanges that I can use later in programs I create.
