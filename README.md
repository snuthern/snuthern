### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my GitHub profile

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Typescript module to create discord bots that you can find in [Discord_Bot_Module.ts](https://github.com/tsdiscord/discordts), and redoing my **portfolio** repo with some cool projects like  [tribute pages](https://snuthern.github.io/blm/) for each person of color killed this year by police violence and a Typescript [Point_Of_Sale.ts](snuthern/snuthern/tree/master/Point_Of_Sale.ts/) software side project. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently using: Deno , TypeScript , Python , and JavaScript  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything Typescript / Deno related  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **Yossi#3116** on Discord or [@queens_kgh](https://twitter.com/queens_kgh) on Twitter   
  
This simple README file serves as a "monorepo" for my portfolio while I redesign my [site](https://snuthern.github.io), I used to have a portfolio repo on here but I removed it when these profile READMEs came out for user profiles. I am in the process of rewriting my Discord module and TorahChat bot, I am creating a point of sale software for a fun side project. Below is a chart that updates daily tracking what languages I am coding in that day using the Wakatime API.
