This simple README file serves as a "monorepo" for my portfolio, I used to have a portfolio repo on here but I removed it when these profile READMEs came out for user profiles. I am in the process of rewriting my Discord module and TorahChat bot, I am creating a point of sale software for a fun side project. Click on the **snuthern** repo below and go to the Wiki to view my projects. I also use the "modules" directory to store code challanges that I can use later in programs I create.
